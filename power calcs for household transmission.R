# First need to create a data-frame for n-person household  
# containing fields for 
# state, 
# time...i.e. time observed, 
# intervention   1 or 0
# household id
# For a five person household there are 2^5 =32 possible states (binary representation of state
# indicates who is infected)   


# For msm need to supply qmatrix giving allowed transitions in continuous time
# i.e. gain or loss of one infection - done
#  specify constraints as follows using qconstraints

#  all transitions involving going from 0 to 1 infected are constrained to be equal
#  all transitions involving going from 1 to 2 infected are constrained to be equal
#  all transitions involving going from 2 to 3 infected are constrained to be equal
# etc
#  all transitions involving going from reduction by 1 of number infected are constrained to be equal

# effect of intervention is then to act as multiplier on rate of transmission
# assume it's a constant multiplier

# Can also to simulations using pmatrix.msm to get transition probs from a fitted model
# But suggest we use MatrixExp command and intensity matrix to simulate the data
# noting that  "For a continuous-time homogeneous Markov process with transition 
#intensity matrix Q, the probability of occupying state s at time u + t conditional
#on occupying state r at time u is given by the (r,s) entry of the matrix exp(tQ).

# So functions are needed to  
# i)  construct intensity matrix,Q, for n person household with and without intervention to affect transmission
# should take as input a background rate of acquisition, a per person rate of transmission
# and a multiplicative effect of intevenion on transmission.
# output is an intensity matrix


# ii) simulate data at different time points for m households
#   inputs are intensity matrix, initial conditions and time points for simulation, and 
#   number of households  
# output is data frame with household ID, intervention (yes or now), state and time


# iii) 

#  construct qconstraint vector which specifies which baseline transitions intensities are 
# equal for n person household 
# input is n, size of the household
# output is a vector of integers, 1,2,3...

#Noting that 
#"the intensity parameters are assumed to be ordered by reading across the rows of the transition matrix, starting at the first row, ignoring the diagonals.

# Note that for an n person household the state numbers are based on 1+binary representation of states
# where 0 is uninfected and 1 is infected
# so for three person household
# 000  = 0 +1 (state 1, no-one infected)
# 001  = 1 +1 (state 2, person 3 infected)
# 110  = 6 +1 (state 7, person 1 and 2  infected)
# 011  = 3 +1 (state 4, person 2 and 3  infected)
